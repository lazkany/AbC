{"name":"AbC","tagline":"The Implementation of AbC Linguistic Primitives ","body":"### Attribute-based Communication.\r\nAbC is a process calculus for attribute-based communication. An AbC system consists of a set of parallel agents each of which is equipped with a set of attributes. Communication takes place in an implicit multicast fashion, and interactions among agents are dynamically established by taking into account \"connections\" as determined by predicates over the attributes of agents.\r\n\r\nIn this page, we present a prototype implementation for AbC linguistic primitives and show how one can exploit these flexible primitives to model different communication models and interaction patterns. In the following sections, we show how to program with AbC primitives naturally and easily. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation Structure\r\n### Attribute-based Interaction\r\nIn this page, we present a prototype implementation for AbC linguistic primitives and show how one can exploit these flexible primitives to model different communication models and interaction patterns.
